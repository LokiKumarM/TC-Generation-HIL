<h1>📝 AI-Powered Test Case Generation with Human in Loop</h1>

Welcome to the AI-Powered Test Case Generation project! 🚀 This repository showcases an advanced Generative AI application that automates the process of test case generation from system requirements, optimizing software validation and reducing manual effort.

Human input / feedback was taken between the execution in order to enhance the llm performance

<h2>Overview</h2>
This project leverages LLMs (Large Language Models) and AI-driven techniques to analyze system requirements and generate comprehensive test cases. The goal is to enhance software validation, reduce human errors, and accelerate the testing process.

<h2>Key Features</h2>

✅ Automated Test Case Generation – Convert system requirements into structured test cases.

✅ LLM-Powered Analysis – Understands complex requirements and extracts meaningful scenarios.

✅ Coverage Optimization – Ensures test cases maximize functional and edge-case coverage.

✅ Customizable Workflows – Supports different testing methodologies (unit, integration, system testing).

✅ Integration with Testing Tools – Designed to work with CI/CD pipelines and test management systems.

<h2>📂Project Breakdown</h2>

- Streamlit application has been built through which Test case generation can be done in the project.

- Vector database used: Chromadb

- Framework used: Langchain

- Embedding model: huggingface embedding model

- Model used: llama 3.3

<h2>🚀 How It Works</h2>

1️⃣ Requirement Analysis and Test sceanrio creation – An LLM(LLM1) is assigned to extract key functionalities of system requirements and generate test scenarios.

2️⃣ Test Case Generation – Another LLM is used to generate test cases with maximum test coverage based on test scenarios generated by LLM1

3️⃣ Human In Loop – An Human Engineer has added in loop of LLM execution and generated test case was evaluated with feedback in order to enchance human performance.

4️⃣ Export & Integration – Generates test cases in various formats(Ex: .csv / .xlsx)
